# Damian's PowerShell Shenanigans

This year I am really trying to get better with PowerShell. Anything from work related tasks that 
once coded get run only a hand full of times, to small functions that I run everyday because 
```Convert-RGBToHex "140, 255, 73"``` at an already running term window is easier than Google.  

Feel free to point out better/best-practice ways to do things, or any fun/interesting code projects
you have!
