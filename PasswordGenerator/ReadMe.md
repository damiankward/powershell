# Powershell Password Generator

This seemed like a fun project to tackle. First time doing any real work with functions/parameters.

Had some struggles with iterating through ranges when generating random passwords, still not 100% how powershell likes to pass information along a pipeline.

Overall a fun learning experience, parts of which are now being implemented as part of my daily workflow.
